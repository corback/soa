BASICS:

# you need to import the script main (the main cycle!), and run it.
# From Gephi command line type:

import sys
#mypath="c:\\soa\\";
mypath='D:\\ELECTIVES\\SELF_ORGA\\new_code\\'
sys.modules.clear();
sys.path.append(mypath);

# make sure that you don't have added wrong paths.
#if you did, pop them one by one like this, till only good path are in/
# sys.path.pop() # then re-append the good one!


import main
main.run(g)

# if it worked, you should see errors related to the code, rather than importing
---
# how to check current directory
import os
os.chdir(mypath)
os.curdir

TODO: now the changes to the weight works. But the changes are not displayed on the graph view.
we need to fix this. Here are two functions we need to explore.
http://gephi.org/docs/toolkit/org/gephi/graph/api/GraphView.html

setVisibleView
void setVisibleView(GraphView view)
    Sets the current visible view and nofity listeners the visible view changed.
    Parameters:
        view - the view that is to be set as the visible view

getVisibleView
GraphView getVisibleView()
    Returns the current viisble view. By default, returns the main view.
    Returns:
        the current visible view

what we are using now is the console in gephi, with  python language
https://gephi.org/2012/python-scripting-console-for-gephi/ 
http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Scripting_Plugin

instead of netbeans working with jython. ( the standard Gephi recommended choice for developing). When all policies are generated and statistics computed, we could think to move to the other system to access unreachable libraries for visuals and perhaps stats..
Also, it seems another independent editor different than netbeans do not work, because of 'the plumbing that netbeans does automatically for you'. 
Hopefully we'll not get too many differences shifting there(...)

# we want the toolkit to be installed: http://gephi.org/toolkit/
# toolkit info can be found here: http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Toolkit_porta
# there is no installation info around the whole web.
# we can either build it from the gephi source code, or download it in the same page
# it contains a java library which, browsed with netbeans, contains our final goal--->> the org.gephi.graph.api
# we should simply be able to use it as a normal .jar
# ok, so 'simply' HOW???!!???

#trying to use the toolkit library.
#added it as a copy-paste at mytoolpath

mytoolpath=' C:\Users\MangustaMegaMastar\AppData\Roaming\.gephi\0.8.1\dev\scripts'
sys.path.append(mytoolpath)
-----IMPORT A DAMN CLASS FROM THE TOOLKIT (<-- https://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/How_to_build_the_Gephi_Toolkit )
#once bult the toolkit from the source code
import sys
graphpath= "C:\\Users\MangustaMegaMastar\\Downloads\\4gephi\\gephi-0.8.1-beta.sources\\gephi-0.8.1-beta.sources\\toolkit\\gephi-toolkit\\org-gephi-graph-api.jar"
sys.path.append(graphpath)
algopath= "C:\\Users\MangustaMegaMastar\\Downloads\\4gephi\\gephi-0.8.1-beta.sources\\gephi-0.8.1-beta.sources\\toolkit\\gephi-toolkit\\org-gephi-algorithms.jar"
sys.path.append(algopath)
from org.gephi.algorithms.shortestpath import AbstractShortestPathAlgorithm
#some_object = SomeClass() # You can now use your java class


#In your case you probably want to use the path of your package to find the jar:
# yourpackage/__init__.py
import sys, os
if 'java' in sys.platform.lower():
    sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),
                                 "your-lib.jar"))
    from jython_implementation import library
else:
    from cpython_implementation import library
#Hope that helps!

SOLVED BUGS: when some complaints is solved, move it down here
 we reached a point where the code iteratively reduces weights according to polici simple.
 no crashes. 

milombo: i keep on seeing that the code from policy looks for node.neighborhood (inexisting field)
even when I corrected and saved the code into node.neighbors. wtf?
