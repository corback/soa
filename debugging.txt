# you need to import the script main (the main cycle!), and run it.
# From Gephi commanf line type:

import sys
#mypath="c:\\soa\\";
mypath='D:\\ELECTIVES\\SELF_ORGA\\new_code\\'
sys.modules.clear();
sys.path.append(mypath);

# make sure that you don't have added wrong paths.
#if you did, pop them one by one like this, till only good path are in/
# sys.path.pop() # then re-append the good one!


import main
main.run(g)

# if it worked, you should see errors related to the code, rather than importing
---
# how to check current directory
import os
os.chdir(mypath)
os.curdir

milombo: i keep on seeing that the code from policy looks for node.neighborhood (inexisting field)
even when I corrected and saved the code into node.neighbors. wtf?
